# ConnecTogether

> An Android Application that focuses on connecting multiple devices together to create one bigger screen that the user can easily 
interact with and use with their friends and family. The motivation behind this project was how mobile phones are not big 
enough to do some of the activities that users want to do and if the user wants a device that is bigger and doesnâ€™t fit in a pocket, 
it becomes really uncomfortable for the user to carry it around. There is no existing solution to make both of these problems go 
away.

> The aim is to develop an application that enables multiple smartphone devices to be joined together to create a bigger display 
without using any external connections like bluetooth or the internet that any type of users can easily reach and use.

> Over the course of the project, it became really clear that the workload has been set initially was ambitious and a bit too much, 
with many long nights required to meet the milestones that was set out by the plan. This made the functionality of the project to 
be different from what was set initially with some additions to it and some deletions from it. Even though with many ups and 
downs, the project was completed and the functionality was set to working.
